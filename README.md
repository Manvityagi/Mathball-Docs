**Mathball** is an npm package for competitive programming in [JavaScript][1] with a focus on common mathematical utilities being implemented in relevant algorithms & data structures for optimized performance!

JavaScript was never built while keeping competitive coding in mind; let us all agree on that. But, the stuff that we build with it today was not something it was built for either! Back in 1995, [Brendan Eich][2] developed JavaScript only for adding interactivity to web pages like handling a mouse click. Today, we can build _servers_, _games_, _mobile apps_, _IoT apps_ and even _machine learning_ in the browser is possible with JavaScript.

> "Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript." -- Atwood's Law.

Based on the notion - **JS is everywhere!** I also believe that maybe its time to motivate people who are well versed with this language to finally consider it in the realm of competitive programming.
